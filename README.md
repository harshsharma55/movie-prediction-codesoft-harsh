Introduction
The Movie Rating Project aims to predict movie ratings based on user reviews and other relevant data. This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze textual data and predict ratings on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory data analysis
Text vectorization using TF-IDF
Sentiment analysis using machine learning algorithms
Model training and evaluation
Web interface for user interaction
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Git
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-rating-project.git
cd movie-rating-project
Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Preprocess Data
Ensure you have your dataset in the data/ directory. Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:

bash
Copy code
python preprocess.py
Train the Model
Train the machine learning model using the training script:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate_model.py
Run the Web Application
Start the web application to allow users to input reviews and get predicted ratings:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser to use the application.

Data
The dataset used in this project should include user reviews and corresponding movie ratings. You can use publicly available datasets such as the IMDb dataset or collect your own data.

Example Dataset Structure
Review ID	User ID	Movie ID	Review Text	Rating
1	1001	2001	Great movie!	5
2	1002	2002	Not bad, could be better	3
Model Training
The model is trained using various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks. The training script (train_model.py) handles the process of training and saving the model.

Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared. The evaluation script (evaluate_model.py) provides a detailed report on the model's performance.
